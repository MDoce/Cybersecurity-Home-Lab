# Cybersecurity Home Lab

This repository showcases my cybersecurity home lab projects, which are a collection of hands-on experiments, labs, and write-ups I've built to explore cyber security concepts. Everything here runs in a self-contained environment (virtual machines, backer, and other lab setups), so I can safely simulate attacks, defense, and monitor without touching production systems.
